# CompoundFi-Interest-Rate-Swap
Prototype for an interest rate swap contract for the Compound Finance decentralized money market system.

I'd like to emphasize that this is very much a prototype. The logic works, and the data is recent and accurately sourced from Compound Finance themselves, but the frontend is lackluster, the backend is my first script using Solidity, and all of the addresses (for both contracts and wallets) only exist on my local Ethereum testnet.

The main purpose of the project was to tangibly test the possibility of on-chain, decentralized financial derivatives, and the public code is only meant to 'show my work.'
